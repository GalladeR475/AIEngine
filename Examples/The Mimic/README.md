# The Mimic

This type of AI is widely used in the game [The Mimic](https://www.roblox.com/games/6243699076/The-Mimic).
The AI patrols around given roaming points and chases any player on sight.
If the player manages to escape, then the AI returns to patrolling until it finds another player.

This example is directly from the main branch [Horror Monster](https://github.com/Sythivo/AIEngine/tree/master/examples/HorrorMonster)
